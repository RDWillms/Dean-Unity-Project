Lvl1,Milk,Milk is a common ingredient you can find at your gorcery store. The fat proteins that are found in milk can be used to provide creaminess and richness to your favorite dishes.,Ice,Ice is water that is frozen when it reaches 32Â°F or below. It is most commonly used to keep things nice and cold and can also be used to create interesting chain reactions!,,,,,Ice Cream,"Nice you created ice cream! The milk proteins stick to the fat droplets creating a membrane to keep the the shape of the ice cream secure, while the ice helps gives the ice cream a nice texture. You can add other components as well, such as syrup, flavorings, and toppings to make a yummy dessert!",,"Oh why hello there, young scientist!",You arrived just in time to witness my new invention!,"It will change how we interact with the world, nay the universe!","Oh my, where are my manners? You don't even know who I am.",Ahem...,My name is Professor Chem. I've been studying the intricacies of chemistry for the last 15 years.,Chemistry is such an interesting field to study. It is one of the key building blocks to the creation fo our universe after all! ,"I love digging into how combining different components and mixtures create such amazing compounds that we see, smell, and use in our daily lives. ","Hence, the inspiration for my latest invention...The Compounder!",(Trademark Pending),The Compounder is a device I made that takes different mixtures and components and combines them to make compounds used to create amazing products.  ,"A mixture is a substance of one component or element that, when mixed together, creates soemthing entirely new and interesting!","When those mixtures are combined, compounds are made to create gasses, foods, and the world itself!","Did you know that you and everything around you is composed of millions of different complex compounds! Amazing, yes?",I'm so enthralled in the chemical concoctions that make up our world that I wanted to create an invention that would allow chemists like myself to make these compounds with ease.,"Unfortunatley, I've been so cooked up in the lab working on this project that I haven't has the chance to test it yet... ","But, that's where you come in!",I was just looking for an aspiring Junior Chemist to help me take this thing for a spin.,"I know chemistry might seem intimidating to you. I get it, it's a very complex field fo study.","But, I promise you, the Compounder can be used with ease!","Just drag the mixtures into their mixture slots, press the good ol' compound button and let the Compounder do the rest of the work!","It's elementary, really.","So, what are you waiting for? Click the Start Button below and let's get Compounding!"
Lvl2,Water,"Water is an inorganic, transparent, tasteless, odorless, and nearly colorless chemical substance. It makes up 2/3 of the Earth's surface and is a key component in making food, various checmial mixtures, and even life itself!",Salt,Salt is a mineral composed primarily of sodium chloride. It comes from natural crystalline rocks. Salt is very common to find throughout the world and is useful for cooking and checmical compounds.,,,,,Salt Water,"That's salt water! Salt water is water that has a high concentration of dissolved salts, mainly soidum choloride that makes up most of our sea water. It's used to heal infections and as a dposit to extract the salt components. Don't drink it though! Due to it's high salt content, salt water will only make you more thirsty.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lvl3,Water,"Water is an inorganic, transparent, tasteless, odorless, and nearly colorless chemical substance. It makes up 2/3 of the Earth's surface and is a key component in making food, various checmial mixtures, and even life itself!",Sand,"Sand is a granular material composed of disconstructed rock and other earthly elements. You can find sand at beaches, desserts, and in the soil of your backyard.",Gravel,"Gravel is similar to sand as it's a mixture of desconstructed rock. Except, gravel is coarser than sand and contains a variety of metallic deposits. You can find gravel on dirt roads and along certain streams.",,,Concrete,"You created concrete! Combining all these mixtures makes a liquid, maleable substance called cement. It's used mainly in construction for creating sidewalks and building foundations. Once cement is exposed to air, it hardens and creates a hard solid surface known as concrete.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lv4,Charcoal,"Charcoal is the product of hihgly burnt wood with  minimal water or oxygen. It is a black amorphous carbon that can be used to treat poisoning, but is mostly used to produce a high amount of heat for things like grilling or explosives!",Potassium Nitrate,"Potassium Nitrate is an inorganic salt that is can be found as a mineral in the world or construct through mixing different chemicals together. It's used iin food perservatives, fertilizer, and is a key component in fireworks.",Sulfur,Sulfur is a yellow crsytalized substance that is essential for life. It can be found in amino acids and proteins that flow through just about anything living! It has a very strong smell and can be used for some explosive properties.,,,Gunpowder,"Whoa is that gunpowder you just made!? Gunpowder is a key component in weapons from cannons to revolver pistols. Once sparked, it gives off an explosive reaction that produces an immensive force. Be careful with that one!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lv5,Hydrogen,"Hydrogen is a key component in just about anything. Hydrogen is the lightest and most abudant elelemnt in the universe. It helps fuel cells, refine pertroleum, and is one of two main elelments that make up water. ",Carbon,"Carbon is the basic building block required to form proteins, carbohydrates and fats, and it plays a crucial role in regulating the physiology of the body. Carbon has the unique ability to be creat bonds with many different elements to create chemical bonds that make up a lot of our earth's atmopshere.",Sulfur,Sulfur is a yellow crsytalized substance that is essential for life. It can be found in amino acids and proteins that flow through just about anything living! It has a very strong smell and can be used for some explosive properties.,Energy,"Energy is the substance that fuels any action. From the battery in your car to the cells in your body, energy is crucial to making things (and people) work. The law of convversvation states that energy cannot be created nor destroyed.",Life,"Jumping electrons!! Is that...life? Those components must be the basics building blocks of life! Well you know what life is right? It's all around us. It's inside you, the trees outside, and the tiny cells invisible to the naked eye that surround all of us. Truly a remarkable discovery!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
